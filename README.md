# Feature Description:  
**Wall run**-> jump while there is at least one wall on the side of you, or jump into a wall and be given 0.5 seconds of wall run. You can jump off of a wall and start another wall run, while your verticle motion is above -0.7 (changeable in the raycast/wallrun_test file)    
**Wall jump**-> jump while wall run. (you are able to jump back and forth between walls).   
**Vaulting**-> sprint toward an obstacle of 1 block high and vault over it automatically. But be aware you won't be able to go up stairs like this, becuase that would be too broken.
**Climb up chains and end rods**   
**Ledge grab**-> when the player is not on the ground the are able to ledge grab once by sneaking while looking at a block with no blocks on top of it.    
**Slide down walls**-> while falling you can look toward a wall and sneaking to slide down a wall.    
**Spring board jump**-> while vaulting up obstacle press jump at the right moment will give you a much larger jump.    
**Sliding**-> sneaking while sprinting for 1.15 seconds. (if you want to jump you need to sneak quickly, before the player reaches jump height above 1.2 blocks).
